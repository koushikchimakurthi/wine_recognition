# wine_recognition
Wine recognition using clustering and classification techniques

There are 3 files i.e. part1, part2_clustering and part3_classification in the folder which are .py files.

Each file should be run individually for each part to execute.

I have used sklearn.datasets api to load the dataset in each .py file so there is no need to load the dataset with any path.

If all the modules are present there is no need to do anything except running the file, otherwise if any module is missing,
Please install that specific module individually or just execute this command :

pip install -r requirements.txt


NOTE
In part2_clustering and part3_classification files when they are run, the graph plots will pop up and "PLEASE DON'T CLOSE" them as it will rise an error
cause i have given a timer of 2 seconds for each plot to appear and then disappear in the code.
